				<p>Green Arrow is a vigilante superhero who fights crime using archery, technology, and martial arts. In his secret identity he is politician and billionaire Oliver Queen, a hot-headed social activist and owner of Queen Industries.</p>
                <p>As a young child, Oliver idolized his hero Robin Hood and was said to be a natural archer, frequently practicing with his bow and arrows. He was mildly traumatized the first time he accidentally killed an animal, but, after his parents were mauled by lions in a tragic safari accident, Oliver learned the cost of his hesitance to shoot.</p>
                <p>
					Trapped on Starfish Island
					
					However, everything changed when Oliver fell off his personal boat in the middle of the Pacific Ocean and washed ashore on the remote, isolated Starfish Island. All that Oliver salvaged from the wreckage was a memorabilia bow from a Robin Hood movie he treasured, which he used to help keep him afloat in the ocean. During this time spent without food or shelter, Queen developed his skills as a hunter to survive and gained mastery over his bow. Having previously taken everything in his life for granted, this experience taught him self-reliance and made him into a man.</p>
